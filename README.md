Interpreting the patterns of the serial killers
===============================================

There is no control over the surge of crimes reported all over the world, driven by various motives of the killer, moreover, there are serial killers who are striving to hunt their victims and end up being convicted of multiple murders. A serial killer typically is a person who commits the unlawful killing of two or more victims.

For this analysis, the data set obtained consists of the different behaviours or patterns that initiates a serial killer in committing a crime. There are several variables from the data set that can be helpful for the analysis, but the ones that are of interest would be “Motive” and “AgeFirstKill”, which state the reason behind committing a crime and the age of the killer when committing the first murder. There are three different motives included in the data set, through which the objective arises of finding out whether the average age at first murder differs between killers with different motives, and testing whether the proposed mean of 27 years is equal to that of the sample mean.
